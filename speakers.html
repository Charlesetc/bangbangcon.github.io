          <p>I like checksums! I like Taylor Swift! Some people don't understand checksums! Some people don't understand Taylor Swift! But what's the big deal? That's okay! I want to give a talk that gives an overview of different checksum technologies when used for file fixity (and a little bit of information transformation and security) at a broad level using Taylor Swift lyrics as a reference and source of explanation and enlightenment because I think this tech is SO WEIRD AND INTERESTING and I also feel that way about Taylor Swift. Also I think it's fun. It will be fun. It will be at least 50% Taylor Swift.</p>

          <p>Quines are self-printing programs.  Every program can print out its own source code, and storage has become exceedingly cheap.  So, we introduce Quinine, a library that uses fixed points, analytic philosophy, and tape storage tools to make open-source programs that carry their source code with themselves.</p>

          <p>On Majuro Atoll, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, I was tasked with setting up a technology education program. The students and teachers were among the 50,000 people in the world who speak Marshallese, a language I knew next to nothing about. And they have special Unicode letters in their alphabet! Writing apps to support them proved difficult.</p>

          <p>I discovered that most people use a custom font to read and write Marshallese letters by replacing x's, k's, and other letters on their American keyboards. Through some hacking with Unicode, JavaScript, and GitHub, I got a special keyboard added to Wikipedia and its open source library <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME</a>. And I ended up with some useful internationalization and localization knowledge!</p>

          <p>Ever wanted to build wacky interfaces for shaping sound? Turns out it's easier than you might expect! By combining Arduino, a beginner-friendly electronic prototyping platform, and ChucK, a musical programming language, we can build some weird electronic musical instruments. Prior knowledge required: basic programming skills and an active imagination. I'll show off one of my experiments and discuss how to go about imagining your own projects.</p>

          <p>Whenever something has gone seriously wrong for me in production, caching has been at the root of it. Live Q&amp;A with Julian Assange almost brought the site down? Caching fail. Servers can't cope with traffic about a new woolly rat? Caching fail. Half the site is showing sorry pages? Caching fail. This talk will use these disasters to explain why it's important to keep caching simple.</p>

          <p><strong><em>What Programmers and Economists Can Learn from Each Other!</em></strong></p>

          <p>Over the past twenty years, I've been a sysadmin, researcher, and graduate student in economics. Somewhere in the past couple of years, I became a software engineer. With these varied experiences, I found that there were skills and practices I learned as a programmer that would've helped me in economics (for example, writing good tests, or coding with an eye towards modularity).</p>

          <p>Similarly, there were lessons I learned while studying economics that I've taken with me to programming (making technical decisions at the margin, solving problems while being mindful of endogeneity). And there are things that both programmers and economists can and should learn, especially regarding understanding limitations of their respective toolkits and the importance of working with compassion and empathy.</p>

          <p>In this talk, I'd like to share some of these lessons, with motivating examples of the research process.</p>

          <p>Cell phones are awesome! But how do they work? We all know there's a part you talk into and a part that your friend talks out of, BUT WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE?</p>

          <p>I decided to find out by designing and building my very own cell phone out of resistors and capacitors and other really small stuff. (I had to buy tweezers.)</p>

          <p>Everybody knows that feeling — you're in the middle of tracking down a complicated piece of multithreaded non-determinism gone wrong. You're stepping through your code in the debugger, watching breakpoints fly by, and SUDDENLY it's too late! The problem you're watching for has already occurred, and you need to start all over again. Or do you?</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://rr-project.org">rr</a> tool is the harbinger of an exciting new era of hassle-free debugging. Time travel has never been simpler, and an eidetic memory is within your grasp today! You will not believe how these wacky longstanding bugs in Firefox were solved!</p>

          <p><strong><em>Cross-platform file names in Rust: a wonderful and horrifying hack!</em></strong></p>

          <p>On Unix, file names (and other strings in system APIs) are arbitrary 8-bit bytes &mdash; usually UTF-8, but not necessarily. On Windows, they're "wide" strings of arbitrary 16-bit units &mdash; usually UTF-16, but not necessarily.</p>

            <p>Either way, your program should not crash when it encounters a weird file name. The Rust standard library has a clever hack to deal with this in cross-platform code and mostly hide the complexity from users. Let's dive into the gory details!</p>

          <p><strong><em>Recovering data from an SD card &mdash; the hard way!</em></strong></p>

          <p>A while ago, I accidentally snapped an SD card in half. It had a bunch of photos on it that I didn't have backed up, but on the other hand, I don't believe in losing data! After discovering that the memory chip on it was still intact, but that the controller chip was dead, I decided to try to pull the data out of the raw memory chip.  Along the way, I learned a whole bunch of stuff about flash memory.  I also learned that people jump through a lot of hoops in order to make flash memory behave like a hard drive, when in reality, the two aren't much alike at all!</p>

          <p>In this talk, I'll tell you more about the story of putting the pieces back together, and I'll give you an introduction to some of those strange things that people do with flash.  Also, you can laugh at me for not making backups.</p>

          <p class="speaker-bio"><strong><a href="http://www.joshuawise.com/">Joshua</a></strong> spends most of his time at work during the week alternating between writing specifications that turn into chips and reading climbing blogs.  He doesn't really believe in learning his lesson, either, and probably will show up to his talk with an SD card hanging out of the side of his laptop, ready to be smashed in half once again.</p>
