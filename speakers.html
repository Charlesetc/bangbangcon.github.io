		  <p><strong><em>How to Stay in Love with Programming</em></strong></p>

		  <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille Fournier</a></strong>
		  has been nerding up all the things since
		  Amigas were cool and having access to Gopher was the
		  hotness. She proudly writes most of her code in Java, burned
		  out on functional programming in the 90s, and still really
		  doesn't get CSS. Her hobbies include weightlifting, vintage
		  fashion, tweeting, and helping keep 100% volunteer open
		  source projects from falling into disrepair. She also runs
		  the engineering team at Rent the Runway.</p>

		  <h3>David Nolen</h3>

		  <p><strong><em>Code Diversity</em></strong></p>

		  <p>"A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points." &mdash;
		  Alan Kay</p>

		  <p>Different computational approaches deeply shape how we
			solve problems. Too often people treat their technological
			choices like religions, willfully blinding themselves to
			better solutions for the task at hand. Diversifying your
			computational mindset puts technology back in its rightful
			subservient place: a set of modular, limited tools for
			augmenting unlimited human thought.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolen</a></strong>
		  is a software engineer for Cognitect.  He
		  enjoys making music, writing JavaScript, writing
		  ClojureScript, and exploring new approaches to user
		  interface programming.</p>

		  <h3>Lisa Neigut</h3>

		  <p><strong><em>Serial! It's what's for breakfast.</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Me: I want to write a program that talks to a serial
		  port. Reality: What is serial port? How does work?</p>

		  <P>This talk aims to fill in that reality gap. I'll cover
		  the basics of what serial is, how it works (RTS/CTS, stop
		  signals, buffers), and possibly go over how to
		  write/interact with Unix serial ports (in C or walk through
		  part of the python pyserial library. TBD).</p>

		  <p>All serial info to be based on the RS-232 protocol.</p>

		  <p><strong>Lisa</strong> is an artisanal cereal chef. Her current favorite is
		  coconut orange macadamia granola. She spends most of her
		  working hours playing with Java and Gradle on Android at
		  Etsy.</p>

		  <h3>Danielle Sucher and Darius Bacon</h3>

		  <p><strong><em>Nantucket! Detecting accidental
		  verse</em></strong></p>

		  <p>We wrote programs to find text that matches verse forms
		  like sonnets and limericks. We'll explain how, and subject
		  you to some of the output.</p>

		  <p>When <strong><a href="http://www.daniellesucher.com">Danielle
		  Sucher</a></strong> was a kid, she wanted to grow up to live
		  in a library in a lighthouse and spend all her time learning
		  and solving puzzles and making stuff. Except for the
		  lighthouse (so far), that's pretty much what her grown-up
		  life has become.</p>

		  <p>Wikipedia
		  called <strong><a href="http://wry.me/blog">Darius
		  Bacon</a></strong> a poet, which he thinks is hilarious. He
		  writes toy programs pretty often, and not so many serious
		  ones. He will be in New York for the rest of May.</p>

		  <h3>David Turner</h3>

		  <p><strong><em>Now you're thinking with PCMPISTRI!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I needed a custom string comparison routine, and the C
		  version wasn't fast enough. It turns out that modern Intel
		  processors have SIMD instructions that understand C-style
		  strings. So I considered writing a faster version in
		  assembly language. I actually ended up solving the problem a
		  different way, but I decided to write the SIMD assembly
		  version anyway. This sort of programming is tremendously
		  fun, because you have these weird instructions and you have
		  to try to solve your problem under bizarre and arbitrary
		  constraints.</p>

		  <p><strong><a href="http://novalis.org/">David Turner</a></strong> hacks on
		  git at Twitter. He previously co-founded OpenTripPlanner,
		  and worked on version 3 of the GPL. He enjoys contributing
		  patches to random projects, like Inkscape and Linux. He
		  lives on Mars with his glorious wife and three pet
		  tigers.</p>
