          <h2>Call for talk proposals!</h2>

          <p>Hi! !!Con is <strong>returning for a third year</strong> of celebrating the joy, excitement, and surprise of programming, and we want <strong>you</strong> to submit a talk proposal.</p>

          <p>What delights you about programming?  Do you have a favorite algorithm or data structure?  A great story about that time you found a super-weird bug?  A tool that you learned about and now you're telling everyone and their cat?  We like good storytelling and unreasonable excitement more than programming wizardry (though wizard stories are very welcome!).

          <p>We want to hear from tinkerers and practical types, scientists and artists, teachers and students, ordinary programmers and out-of-the-ordinary ones. We want to hear from you if you love programming for its own sake, or if you don't find intrinsic joy in programming but love what you can create with it.  We don't care if what you talk about is "not smart enough" or "done before"; if you think it's cool, we want to hear from you.</p>

          <p>The only requirements are that your talk:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>be programming-related!</li>
            <li>be about something you think is interesting and cool!</li>
            <li><strong>have at least one exclamation mark in the title!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>We would <strong>especially</strong> like to hear from you if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>you submitted a talk proposal in 2014 or 2015 that was rejected (we've had to reject <strong>so many</strong> talk proposals we loved).</li>
            <li>you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming conferences. We're committed to doing work to make !!Con a good experience for more people.  See our <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>All talks will be ten minutes long.</strong> Ten minutes isn't much time, so think carefully about the scope of your talk. A single, focused idea is better than a broad, rambling one.</p>

          <p>The submission deadline is <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20160318T235959&p0=179&msg=!!Con+2016+Talk+Proposal+Deadline&ud=1&font=cursive&csz=1">March 18</a>. We'll accept as many of your amazing talks as we can. You can submit more than one talk proposal.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposals will be anonymized to avoid bias.</strong> Although we ask for your name, email address, and so on in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15hvzXacn1O8Y9R_RQrn6g8ofuPXSFg8Uh4f-ge9Plcg/viewform">proposal submission form</a>, only one organizer who serves as anonymizer will actually see this information.  The rest of the <a href="index.html#organizers">organizing team</a> will review your proposal.</p>

          <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15hvzXacn1O8Y9R_RQrn6g8ofuPXSFg8Uh4f-ge9Plcg/viewform">Submit your talk proposal today!</a></p>

          <a name="speaker-funding"></a>
          <h2>Speaker travel funding</h2>

          <p>We will do our best to offer financial assistance for travel expenses for outside-of-NYC speakers.  If you're not from the NYC area and you want to request funding, please fill out the relevant section of <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15hvzXacn1O8Y9R_RQrn6g8ofuPXSFg8Uh4f-ge9Plcg/viewform">the proposal submission form</a>.  If you request travel funding and we accept your proposal, we will let you know if we can provide the funding by April 4th.  You will then have until April 11 to decide whether to accept our invitation to speak.</p>

          <p>Because submissions are reviewed anonymously, requesting financial assistance will not affect a proposal's chances of acceptance.</p>

          <p>Thanks for submitting to !!Con!</p>
