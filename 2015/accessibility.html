          <h2>Accessibility information</h2>

          <p><strong>Important: !!Con has moved to a NEW LOCATION in Brooklyn, NY!</strong></p>

          <p>!!Con 2015 will be held at the <a href="http://magnet.nyu.edu/">NYU MAGNET</a> space, located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2+MetroTech+Roadway,+Brooklyn,+NY+11201">2 MetroTech Roadway, 8th Floor, Brooklyn NY 11201</a>.  <strong>We'll update this page as soon as possible with accessibility details about our new space.</strong></p>

          <!-- <p>!!Con is at <a href="http://www.recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a>, which is on the second floor of 455 Broadway in Manhattan. There is one step at the entrance to the building; on the days of the event, we will have a ramp in place. Once inside, you have the choice of an elevator or stairs to take you to the second floor. The entire conference space, including restrooms, talk areas, quiet rooms, and eating areas, is on a single floor with no steps between areas of the space.</p> -->

          <!-- <p>We are 0.4 miles away from the Broadway-Lafayette subway station, which is fully accessible (B, D, F, M, and 6 trains), and a couple of blocks away from the Canal St station, which is partially accessible (the 6 train only).  Before your trip, check <a href="http://web.mta.info/mta/eles.html">the MTA website</a> for elevator and escalator status.</p> -->

          <p>We will have real-time captioning in English of all the talks at !!Con.</p>

          <p>!!Con is fun, but hectic.  During the entire event, we will have designated quiet rooms for people who want to take a break from the excitement.</p>

          <!-- <p>The Recurse Center has two single-occupancy, gender-neutral restrooms.</p> -->

          <p><em>Do you require other accommodations or have concerns or questions about accessibility at !!Con?  We're here to help!  Contact <a href="index.html#organizers">the organizers</a>.</em></p>
