### Ramsey Nasser

**_The Unfortunate Value of Failure_**

**Ramsey Nasser** is a Lebanese computer scientist, game designer, and
educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by

itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones,
and are often built using experimental tools of his design. A former

reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains
vintage motorcycles.
