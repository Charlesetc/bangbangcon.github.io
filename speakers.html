			  <h3>Ramsey Nasser</h3>

			  <p><strong><em>The Unfortunate Value of
			  Failure</em></strong></p>

			  <p class="speaker-bio"><strong>Ramsey
			  Nasser</strong> is a Lebanese computer
			  scientist, game designer, and educator based
			  in Brooklyn. He researches programming
			  languages by building tools to make
			  computation more expressive and implementing
			  projects that question the basic assumptions
			  we make about code itself. His games
			  playfully push people out of their comfort
			  zones, and are often built using
			  experimental tools of his design. A former
			  Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table
			  Coders, when he is not reasoning about
			  abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and
			  maintains vintage motorcycles.</p>
