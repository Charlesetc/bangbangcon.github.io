## Call for talk proposals!

Hi! !!Con is back for our **fourth year** of celebrating the joy,
excitement, and surprise of computing, and we want **you** to submit a
talk proposal.

**Stay tuned -- our call for proposals will open soon!**

Over the [last](2016/) [three](2015/) [years](2014/), !!Con talks have
featured everything from poetry generation to Pok√©mon; from machine
knitting to electroencephalography; from quantum computing to old DOS
games.  Do you have a favorite algorithm or data structure?  A great
story about that time you found a super-weird bug?  A tool that you
learned about and now you're telling everyone and their cat?

We want to hear from tinkerers and practical types, scientists and
artists, teachers and students, ordinary programmers and
out-of-the-ordinary ones.  We don't care if what you talk about is
"not smart enough" or "done before"; if you think it's cool, we want
to hear from you.

The only requirements are that your talk:

  * be computing-related!
  * be about something you think is interesting and cool!
  * **have at least one exclamation mark in the title!**

We would **especially** like to hear from you if:

  * you submitted a talk proposal in 2014-2016 that was rejected
    (we've had to reject **so many** talk proposals we loved).
  * you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming
    conferences. We're committed to doing work to make !!Con a good
    experience for more people.  See our
    [code of conduct](conduct.html).

**All talks will be ten minutes long.** Ten minutes isn't much time,
so think carefully about the scope of your talk. A single, focused
idea is better than a broad, rambling one.

The submission deadline is **TBD**. We'll
accept as many of your amazing talks as we can. You can submit more
than one talk proposal.

**Proposals will be anonymized to avoid bias.** Although we ask for
your name, email address, and so on in the proposal submission form,
only one organizer who serves as anonymizer will actually see this
information.  The rest of the [organizing team](index.html#organizers)
will review your proposal.

**Stay tuned -- our call for proposals will open soon!**

## Speaker travel funding

We will do our best to offer financial assistance for travel expenses
for outside-of-NYC speakers.  If you're not from the NYC area and you
want to request funding, please fill out the relevant section of the
proposal submission form.  If you request travel funding and we accept
your proposal, we will let you know if we can provide the funding when
we notify you about your proposal acceptance.  You will then have time
to decide whether you want to participate.

Because submissions are reviewed anonymously, requesting financial
assistance will not affect a proposal's chances of acceptance.

Thanks for submitting to !!Con!
