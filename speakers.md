**_The Unfortunate Value of Failure_**

**Ramsey Nasser** is a Lebanese computer scientist, game designer, and
educator based in Brooklyn. He researches programming languages by
building tools to make computation more expressive and implementing
projects that question the basic assumptions we make about code
itself. His games playfully push people out of their comfort zones,
and are often built using experimental tools of his design. A former
Eyebeam fellow and a member of Kitchen Table Coders, when he is not
reasoning about abstract unintuitive machines, he builds and maintains
vintage motorcycles.

### Mark Allen

**_"values of Œ≤ may give rise to dom!"_**

In what may be the strangest error message of all time, we are warned
that values of beta may give rise to dom! This bizarre error message
made it into early UNIX releases. Why? What caused it? What is Œ≤? How
can we stop the insidious rise of dom?!

UNIX publicly debuted in 1974 in an article in the _Communications of
the ACM_, and it has thrived and prospered ever since. In this talk,
we will take a whirlwind tour through the error handling subsystems of
an early UNIX kernel and its utilities, with an eye toward what those
techniques tell us about system design.

**Mark Allen** enjoys singing, being a dad and smoking
things...brisket, mostly.

**_How I fixed UNIX atime! With 10 lines of code and feminism!!!_**

File systems are way too hard for ordinary people to understand,
right? No way!!! I'll explain how I saved billions of unnecessary disk
writes by fixing one of the oldest file system problems in existence
--- UNIX file access time updates! I'll explain it in terms even a
computer beginner can understand! And I'll show how feminism helped me
do it!!!

**Valerie Aurora** is a former file systems hacker turned diversity in
tech consultant at Frame Shift Consulting. She co-founded the Ada
Initiative and loves giant squid and ball lightning.

**_Debugging debuggers!!!_**

Debuggers are one of the most important tools in the programmer's
toolkit, but also one of the most overlooked pieces of
technology. They have to work in some of the harshest conditions,
supporting a huge set of programming languages and aggressive
transformations by compilers. What makes them work? And when don't
they work?

In this talk, I will take you on a journey to some of the darkest and
most confusing pits of systems programming involving debug formats,
compilers and process control. I will describe situations where
debuggers have failed you, and why. If you're not hacking on debuggers
and are not a masochist, you will walk away with an increased
appreciation of life.

**Samy** is the co-founder of Backtrace, where he helps build an
integrated debugging platform with debuggers that try to automatically
debug. He lives in Brooklyn and his passions include software
performance and multicore synchronization and run-on sentences.

**_How I Code and Use a Computer at 1,000 WPM!!_**

I use a computer very differently than most people, because I'm
blind. When I'm surfing the web, tweeting, checking email, reading the
news, and writing code, I'm doing so because a program called a screen
reader is reading me what's on the screen. I happen to listen to it
read me this text at a thousand words per minute! Join me in listening
to how I experience some common user interfaces. Yes, I'll slow it
down for you. I also have a challenge for everyone in the
audience. Can you get through a day only using the keyboard? What
about not looking at your screen?

**Sina Bahram** is an accessibility consultant, researcher, and
entrepreneur. He is the founder of Prime Access Consulting (PAC), an
accessibility firm whose clients include high-tech startups, fortune
1000 companies, and both private and nationally-funded museums.

**_Code in Spaaaaaace!!!_**

How do you write software that needs to perform perfectly a decade
from now as it hurtles by an unexplored planet at thirty thousand
miles per hour? Welcome to the world --- er, universe :) --- of
interplanetary spacecraft flight software, where "launching" your
software takes on a whole new meaning. Cosmic rays, constrained
memory, execution time limits, and billions of miles between
maintainer and program are a few of the challenges we'll explore in
this talk.

Before running the New Horizons spacecraft as a flight controller for
the first-ever reconnaissance of Pluto and Charon, **Katie** wrote
flight software for that spacecraft and one of the scientific
instruments aboard a Mercury orbiter. She loves practicing the Way of
Tea and mucking about in caves.

**_The tales of the cursed operating systems textbook!_**

I have a cursed operating systems textbook --- each chapter I read
unearths a new bug in the systems I work on.  Come hear my tales of
woe:

  * the chapter on kernel data structures that conjured up memory
    leaks INSIDE THE KERNEL!
  * the catastrophic slowdown caused by the syscalls chapter, narrowly
    averted by the magic of `strace`!
  * the networking chapter and the 200ms slowdown in EVERY network
    call we were making!
  * AND MORE!

Along our journey, we'll acquire some fantastic operating systems
tools and incantations you can use to vanquish even the scariest bugs!

**Kiran Bhattaram** loves making things, whether tinkering with
circuits, writing software systems, or sewing dresses. She works on
Stripe's infrastructure team, and has previously built things for
the New York Times, LinkedIn and MIT CSAIL.

**_Making Money Disappear with Hash Functions!_**

What is a Bitcoin address? Where do all those weird letters and
numbers come from!? Once we figure it out, we can dig deep between the
cushions of the cryptocurrency couch and find lost coins claimed by
bugs.

You might think this would dissuade me from trying to generate
addresses and transactions from scratch, but it didn't. Watch in
horror as I put my own money at the mercy of my code.

**Brendan** teaches mathematics to college students in Montreal, bikes
up hills, and creates beer in his kitchen. He has had numerous
experiences that should convince any reasonable person that trying to
do everything from scratch is generally a bad idea, but somehow still
has yet to learn.

**_A Shot in the Dark!_**

Cameras can be intimidating to new photographers. They're full of
options and toggles that don't always have obvious results. Preset
modes make it easier to take great photos, but their underlying
mechanics often remain a mystery. Learn how to reverse-engineer a
preset camera mode and uncover the secrets contained in these (often
literal) black boxes.

**Brendan** writes code for a living and takes photos for fun. He
still has a lot to learn about both.

**_My favorite Unicode character: the zero-width joiner!_**

Some people have favorite numbers, and since character encodings are
basically mappings from binary numbers to characters, I think it's
pretty much equivalent to say I have a favorite character! U+200D ZERO
WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ) is used to combine separate characters, usually in
Indic and Arabic scripts. In my life as an English speaker and writer,
it‚Äôs used to make combinations of emoji, such as üë©+‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äç+üë©= üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©.  I'll
talk about how and why this works, and how it might affect the text
that users submit and you display.

**Anne DeCusatis** is currently a Core Engineer at Meetup. Before
that, she was the December 2014 Outstanding Graduate for Computer
Science at the State University of New York at New Paltz, and an
intern with IBM WebSphere Test. In her spare time, she organizes
MergeSort NYC, a feminist hackerspace.

**_My favorite NP-complete problem!_**

NP-complete problems are the hardest problems whose solutions can be
efficiently checked for correctness. An efficient method of solving
any NP-complete problem would translate directly into efficient
solutions for all of them.

Many famous and interesting problems are NP-complete, but this is not
one of them!  This is the problem of how to distribute ‚ÄúElmo‚Äôs World‚Äù
segments onto a series of video releases.

Nobody knows a good way to solve NP-complete problems.  The Elmo‚Äôs
World people were not able to solve their problem either.

[**Mark Dominus**](http://blog.plover.com/) first became interested in programming in the mid-1970s from
watching his mom do it. He is thrilled to find his bio
adjacent to Julia Evans‚Äô and will gleefully treasure his screenshot of
this page.

**_How to trick a neural network!_**

I used to think neural networks were magical black boxes that I could
never understand. And they kind of are! But in this talk, we're going
to trick an awesome smart neural network, trained by Google, into
thinking a panda is a vulture. Live. And tricking something is the
first step towards understanding it! No prior understanding of neural
networks or machine learning required.

**Julia Evans** thinks you can be a wizard programmer.

**_I'm not a number, I'm a free file descriptor!!1 (Our protagonist
  promptly disappears down a wormhole)_**

File descriptors are the things that tie Unix programs together ---
they let your program work with files, sockets, terminals, and even
weirder, abstracter-er things!

Our programs can pass file descriptors around via process inheritance,
or we can pass them down (you guessed it!) another file descriptor,
which is a pretty neat solution to some problems!

But things get REALLY WEIRD and FUN once you realize you can pass
those file descriptors down themselves, back to your own program. Why
would you do that, and how?! We will find out!

[**Andreas**](https://boinkor.net) is a full-time punner and
occasional programmer. By day, he builds systems at Stripe, and at
night he tries to extract music from a weird instrument.

**_Making a Metaverse! A WebVR (not so M)MO for Programmers!_**

VR is upon us!  After seeing Brian Peiris' AMAZING "web-based live
coding environment for Virtual Reality"
[RiftSketch](https://github.com/brianpeiris/RiftSketch), I was
inspired to make my own version.  Motivated by questions like 'What if
everything in a virtual world was a separate program?', 'What if
anyone could look at the code for these programs and create their own
within the world?', and 'What if this world was as accessible as
opening a window in your browser?', I got to work and using a
combination of WebVR, Three.js, and Meteor, I built a prototype I call
the [Construct Club](http://www.construct.club).

In this talk I'll describe the (somewhat surprisingly straightforward)
programming ideas used to build such a world and touch on the
potential uses and future directions of the project as well as
revealing its slightly more nefarious roots and purposes.

**Irvin** is interested in the process of finding patterns and
abstractions, communities (both virtual and not so virtual, especially
related to education, programming, and creativity), and sandwiches.
He works at Skillshare.

**_What Programmers and Economists Can Learn from Each Other!_**

_(Note: This talk was originally scheduled to appear at !!Con 2015.)_

Over the past twenty years, I've been a sysadmin, researcher, and
graduate student in economics. Somewhere in the past couple of years,
I became a software engineer. With these varied experiences, I found
that there were skills and practices I learned as a programmer that
would've helped me in economics (for example, writing good tests, or
coding with an eye towards modularity).

Similarly, there were lessons I learned while studying economics that
I've taken with me to programming (making technical decisions at the
margin, solving problems while being mindful of endogeneity). And
there are things that both programmers and economists can and should
learn, especially regarding understanding limitations of their
respective toolkits and the importance of working with compassion and
empathy.

In this talk, I'd like to share some of these lessons, with motivating
examples of the research process.

**[Rob Jefferson](http://techstep.org)** is a software engineer for
[Solutions for Progress](http://www.solutionsforprogress.com/), a

**_Finding out what's *really* going on, with DTrace!_**

It's super-frustrating to run into an issue you don't understand. I
hate feeling powerless like that. But luckily DTrace has our backs!

In this talk, I'll show you how DTrace can answer incredibly specific
questions to test our hypotheses when trouble strikes, and help us to
generate new questions and hypotheses. And along the way, it'll become
clear that it's not as scary of a tool as it might first appear!

**Colin Jones** is CTO at 8th Light, where he works with teams to
craft reliable, maintainable software. He's into Clojure, security,
distributed systems, and performance.

**_Ink on fingers! The history of printing (with code!) before
  computer screens_**

What do you imagine when you hear "letter press" or "typesetter"? You
might think of the Gutenberg Bible or a hip print shop in Brooklyn,
but typesetting machines attracted many engineers' creative curiosity
long before everyone had their own home printer or a website.

The typesetting machine was invented out of "don't repeat yourself"
mentality, and was one of the first machines to be automated. Before
we had computer screens, programmers were making domain-specific
languages to print images with code. Ken Thompson once hacked on a
typesetter to create emoji for his chess machine.  Modern software
like WYSIWIG editors would not exist if these creative programmers
hadn't put ink on their fingers. Let's look back at the part of
computing history that underlies daily activities like writing
documentation in Markdown and reacting with emoji!

**Mariko** is an engineer who loves data and knitting. When she is not
making software at Scripto, she uses code to help her design textiles
and organize a local JavaScript meetup in New York City called

**_Sorting is as easy as 1, 2, 3 --- but not as easy as a, b, c!_**

The task of sorting a list of strings alphabetically can sound
trivial, but in fact it's very tricky!  We discovered this the hard
way when attempting to alphabetically sort a list of names in
Japanese. The Japanese written language employs four different
alphabets, and an ordering often based on pronunciation. When multiple
alphabets are at play, how do computers know what the right ordering
should be?  And then what happens to the sorting when pronunciations
of words change depending on their context? We will discuss how using
a Collator can solve some of these problems, and what else you can do
in order to address the rest of them. Be prepared for your assumptions
about text and language to be challenged!

**Jake** has been an engineer at Meetup for 6 years, and is currently
lead engineer on the International team. He also has a Bachelor's of
Engineering from McGill University. And he loves sandwiches.

**_Mixing Paint! With Computers!_**

Mixing paints is fairly straightforward: with the primary colors red,
yellow and blue, you make orange by mixing red and yellow, green by
mixing yellow and blue, and purple by mixing red and blue.

But what if you're trying to mix paints digitally, where the colors
are reduced to a series of numbers? Suddenly, things aren't so
straightforward: how do you even blend colors? By averaging the values
for the two colors? That can give pretty wonky results: using RGB
notation (red-green-blue, the most common in art programs and in CSS
--- which doesn't even assume yellow as a primary color!), mixing blue
and yellow would give you an...interesting shade of grey. And then
what happens if the color isn't even represented with RGB?

This talk will be an introduction to how computers represent colors,
as well as some techniques for how realistic (or non-realistic...)
color blending is achieved by various programs and algorithms.

**Diana** is a college student who studies computer science mostly
because they like pretty computer things, and spends most of their
time drawing or programming. Or making video games, since that
involves drawing and programming.

**_Lossy text compression, for some reason?!_**

Although it had been hovering at the edge of my consciousness for
decades, I only recently came to really understand how JPEG
compression works. I'm a poet, so once I had this insight---OMG
EVERYTHING IS A WAVEFORM---I had to find some way to apply this
procedure to text. Compressing text with a lossy algorithm seems, on
the surface, to be completely pointless. BUT IS IT?! In this talk I
will discuss my experiments with lossy text compression and show how
the outputs range from completely useless to strangely poetic to
maybe, actually, dare I say it... practical?

**_Upstream/Downstream: Discovering and Displaying Watershed Topology!_**

Where does the rain go once it hits the ground?  Some of it soaks into
the ground, and some of it evaporates.  The rest flows into creeks,
streams, lakes, and rivers, eventually making its way to an ocean.
The route that this water takes is determined by thousands of regions
called watersheds.  Visualizing how these regions connect to each
other involves finding and reformatting some public data, a bit of fun
graph algorithm coding, and some challenging graphics performance
issues associated with the display of nearly 100,000 polygons in your
browser! Come see a demonstration of an interactive open source web
application that you can use to see everything that is upstream or
downstream from any location!

**Mark** has been writing software and playing in creeks and streams
for several decades.  He loves the natural world, geometry, and
programming, and is especially delighted whenever he's able to combine
all three of these things. He is the CTO of FernLeaf Interactive, an

**_A million things to do with a computer!_**

Back in 1971, Cynthia Solomon and Seymour Papert wrote "Twenty things
to do with a computer", about their experiences of teaching children
to use Logo and their ideas for the future.

They were wrong: There's a lot more than twenty. Logo's successor,
Scratch, has over thirteen million things that children and adults
alike have built. Scratch is radically accessible in a way that puts
every other language to shame.

This talk is about the history, present, and future of Scratch --- why
Scratch is about 'coding to learn', and not about 'learning to code'.

**[tef](http://programmingisterrible.com/)** spent half a year working
at Code Club, running workshops, talks, and writing articles and
curriculum materials for 9-11 year olds across the UK.  Teaching is
hard work, which is why tef left, and now reboots computers for
money. Scratch is still tef's favourite programming language.

**_They're functional! They're efficient!! They're persistent data
  structures!!!_**

Functional programming is a cool paradigm to work in, because avoiding
mutable objects can save you a lot of headaches! But when you're using
only immutable objects, you have to create a new object each time
something changes, which means copying even the parts that didn't
change! This can slow things down, and you might even run out of
memory!

Fear not: persistent data structures to the rescue!  They save you
time and space when modifying objects, by reusing parts of the old
object that you don't need to change! Let's find out what that means
and why it is SO AWESOME! And let's learn how to easily use these
structures in JavaScript!

**[Anjana](https://vakila.github.io/)** suffers from a debilitating
case of curiosity, which led her from philosophy to English teaching

**_Preserving Digital Art and Games for 100 Years!_**

Digital art, both non-interactive and interactive, has been an
important part of the digital age. Video games are the most obvious
example: interactive real-time art and narrative. There is much more!
The demoscene, for instance, is a culture of digital art where people
create real-time computer-generated art as close to the metal of the
machine as possible. It is sad to see these incredible pieces lost to
time.

In this talk, I will discuss a tool called OCCAM that can
intelligently determine how to build a virtual machine to run any
digital object. We will preserve and run old art and old DOS games
within a web browser using tools including, but not limited to,
virtual machines and Docker. We will hopefully learn to appreciate art
that is old but new to us!

**_lol im so random!_**

Randomness has many applications in computing ranging from
cryptography and statistics to generative art and simulation, but
where does randomness *come from*? When you ask for a random number
from your system, how truly random is it?

This talk will explore randomness in software practice in a variety of
contexts. Touching on sources of entropy, pseudo-random number
generation, and what it means to be cryptographically secure, this
talk will explore both the algorithms and the APIs that supply us with
random numbers. This talk will also cover the mechanisms for testing
and verifying statistical randomness. Interspersed seemingly randomly
throughout will be some great examples of bots, games, and generative
art that use randomness and procedural generation in creative and
unusual ways. You will come away from this high-level overview with a
newfound sense of respect and awe for the humble `Math.random()`.
