              <p>Industrial computer-controlled knitting machines can quickly and reliably fabricate arbitrary three-dimensional fabric objects (!), but how do I tell one what to make? It turns out that most of what we want to do comes down to four basic machine operations and a lot of repetition. But we're coders (/ music makers / dreamers of dreams), so we know that what "four operations and a lot of repetition" really means is: what are the useful abstractions?</p>

              <p>When it comes down to it, what's an elegant way to tell a machine how to make a hat? Or lace? Or patterned socks? And how might I write that in JavaScript?</p>

I want to give a talk that gives an overview of different checksum technologies when used for file fixity (and a little bit of information transformation and security) at a broad level using Taylor Swift lyrics as a reference and source of explanation and enlightenment because I think this tech is SO WEIRD AND INTERESTING and I also feel that way about Taylor Swift. Also I think it's fun. It will be fun. It will be at least 50% Taylor Swift.</p>

              <p>On Majuro Atoll, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, I was tasked with setting up a technology education program. The students and teachers were among the 50,000 people in the world who speak Marshallese, a language I knew next to nothing about. Even typing the characters of the Marshallese alphabet can be a challenge, and writing apps to support Marshallese proved difficult.</p>

              <p>I discovered that most people use a custom font to read and write Marshallese letters by replacing x's, k's, and other letters on their American keyboards. Through some hacking with Unicode, JavaScript, and GitHub, I got a special keyboard added to Wikipedia and its open source library <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME</a>. And I ended up with some useful internationalization and localization knowledge!</p>

              <p>Ever wanted to build wacky interfaces for shaping sound? Turns out it's easier than you might expect! By combining Arduino, a beginner-friendly electronic prototyping platform, and ChucK, a musical programming language, we can build some weird electronic musical instruments. Prior knowledge required: basic programming skills and an active imagination. I'll show off one of my experiments and discuss how to go about imagining your own projects.</p>

              <p>We answer this question by sharing how BuzzFeed thinks about the spread of content via social platforms. We then talk about how we use graph data to measure virality and the scaling problems we've seen along the way.

              <p><strong><em>What Programmers and Economists Can Learn from Each Other!</em></strong></p>

              <p>Over the past twenty years, I've been a sysadmin, researcher, and graduate student in economics. Somewhere in the past couple of years, I became a software engineer. With these varied experiences, I found that there were skills and practices I learned as a programmer that would've helped me in economics (for example, writing good tests, or coding with an eye towards modularity).</p>

              <p>Similarly, there were lessons I learned while studying economics that I've taken with me to programming (making technical decisions at the margin, solving problems while being mindful of endogeneity). And there are things that both programmers and economists can and should learn, especially regarding understanding limitations of their respective toolkits and the importance of working with compassion and empathy.</p>

              <p>In this talk, I'd like to share some of these lessons, with motivating examples of the research process.</p>

              <p>These days, data scientists use very powerful frameworks and tools to crunch huge amounts of data. They use frameworks that operate at a very high level of abstraction, and often spin up virtual machines that can be across the country or across the world. But even though these computers are "in the cloud" and this is all super abstract, you actually have to understand how the physical spinning metal hard drive works in order to write fast queries! This talk will go through a few examples of how working with the hardware in your system can make your code run literally 100,000 times faster than before!</p>

              <p><strong><em>Dissecting a Bestseller: The Art and Science of Storytelling!</em></strong></p>

              <p>Storytelling has been a pastime since the beginning of humankind, but in the last few years more voices than ever before are being heard, thanks to the internet. Book publishing is no longer an industry guarded by gatekeepers and publishing houses, and anyone can publish works through services such as Kindle Direct Publishing.</p>

              <p>Being an independent author myself, I wondered: what makes a bestseller? Are there trends? Is there some magical formula for book success? I analyzed dozens of books from the bestseller lists on Amazon using natural language processing algorithms. By combining the age-old craft of storytelling with new tools for data analysis, I investigate just what makes a bestseller tick.</p>

              <p>On Unix, file names (and other strings in system APIs) are arbitrary 8-bit bytes &mdash; usually UTF-8, but not necessarily. On Windows, they're "wide" strings of arbitrary 16-bit units &mdash; usually UTF-16, but not necessarily.</p>

              <p>Either way, your program should not crash when it encounters a weird file name. The Rust standard library has a clever hack to deal with this in cross-platform code and mostly hide the complexity from users. Let's dive into the gory details!</p>

              <p>Every time you start a new Java (or Clojure, Scala, and so on) project, your build tool will automagically download a bunch of code from the internet for you. Until last summer, that code was downloaded in the clear. Until last summer, someone sitting in the coffee shop where you code could surreptitiously inject lolcats directly into the Java bytecode you thought you were downloading.</p>

              <p>In this talk, I will show you exactly how to hijack HTTP sessions of unsuspecting strangers who happen to be fetching Java bytecode and infest their code with unimpressed kittens.</p>

              <p>I'll go over how to decompile Java class files, how to draw furry animals using Java bytecode, and how to inject this bytecode into Java archives without breaking what the library actually does. And I'll tell you how I convinced the company that hosts your Java packages to start using SSL.</p>

              <p>The Burrows-Wheeler Transform is my favorite algorithm! It partially sorts data, exposing structural patterns that make other compression algorithms more effective. Amazingly, the original input can be recovered from just the transformed data with just a starting offset.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Lightpainting with Robots! And JavaScript!</em></strong></p>

              <p>About a year ago I bought a uArm desktop robot via Kickstarter. It's tons of fun and I've learned a lot about C and Arduino real-time programming. However, C is a total pain and it'd be much more fun to use JavaScript instead. I'll demonstrate sending the robot commands over serial/Bluetooth from NodeJS.</p>

              <p>I combined this with an RGB LED and a second Arduino controller. This LED can be controlled from the same JS program controlling the robot. Add a dark room and long-exposure photography, and it's possible to create amazing in-camera "paintings" with pure light (no Photoshop).  Presentation will include a few inspirational examples, a dash of code (open-sourced at !!Con), and a live demo.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Recovering data from an SD card &mdash; the hard way!</em></strong></p>

              <p>A while ago, I accidentally snapped an SD card in half. It had a bunch of photos on it that I didn't have backed up, but on the other hand, I don't believe in losing data! After discovering that the memory chip on it was still intact, but that the controller chip was dead, I decided to try to pull the data out of the raw memory chip.  Along the way, I learned a whole bunch of stuff about flash memory.  I also learned that people jump through a lot of hoops in order to make flash memory behave like a hard drive, when in reality, the two aren't much alike at all!</p>

              <p>In this talk, I'll tell you more about the story of putting the pieces back together, and I'll give you an introduction to some of those strange things that people do with flash.  Also, you can laugh at me for not making backups.</p>
