          <p>I like checksums! I like Taylor Swift! Some people don't understand checksums! Some people don't understand Taylor Swift! But what's the big deal? That's okay! I want to give a talk that gives an overview of different checksum technologies when used for file fixity (and a little bit of information transformation and security) at a broad level using Taylor Swift lyrics as a reference and source of explanation and enlightenment because I think this tech is SO WEIRD AND INTERESTING and I also feel that way about Taylor Swift. Also I think it's fun. It will be fun. It will be at least 50% Taylor Swift.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Music! Programming! Arduino! (Or: Building Electronic Musical Interfaces to Create Awesome)</em></strong></p>

          <p>Ever wanted to build wacky interfaces for shaping sound? Turns out it's easier than you might expect! By combining Arduino, a beginner-friendly electronic prototyping platform, and ChucK, a musical programming language, we can build some weird electronic musical instruments. Prior knowledge required: basic programming skills and an active imagination. I'll show off one of my experiments and discuss how to go about imagining your own projects.</p>

          <p class="speaker-bio"><strong><a href="http://blog.bonnieeisenman.com">Bonnie Eisenman</a></strong> is a software engineer at Codecademy in New York. She has spoken at several conferences on topics ranging from ReactJS to musical programming and Arduinos. In her spare time, she enjoys building electronic musical instruments, tinkering with hardware projects, and laser-cutting chocolate.

          <p><strong><em>Time travel, gdb, elephants, and you!!!!</em></strong></p>

          <p>Everybody knows that feeling â€” you're in the middle of tracking down a complicated piece of multithreaded non-determinism gone wrong. You're stepping through your code in the debugger, watching breakpoints fly by, and SUDDENLY it's too late! The problem you're watching for has already occurred, and you need to start all over again. Or do you?</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://rr-project.org">rr</a> tool is the harbinger of an exciting new era of hassle-free debugging. Time travel has never been simpler, and an eidetic memory is within your grasp today! You will not believe how these wacky longstanding bugs in Firefox were solved!</p>

          <p class="speaker-bio"><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/lastontheboat">Josh</a></strong> is a developer for Mozilla, and absolutely loves making open source projects more accessible to new contributors. He also sings in a barbershop quartet called the Bearded Baritones.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Cross-platform file names in Rust: a wonderful and heroic hack!</em></strong></p>

          <p>On Unix, file names (and other strings in system APIs) are arbitrary 8-bit bytes &mdash; usually UTF-8, but not necessarily. On Windows, they're "wide" strings of arbitrary 16-bit units &mdash; usually UTF-16, but not necessarily.</p>

            <p>Either way, your program should not crash when it encounters a weird file name. The Rust standard library has a clever hack to deal with this in cross-platform code and mostly hide the complexity from users. Let's dive into the gory details!</p>

            <p class="speaker-bio"><strong><a href="https://exyr.org/about/">Simon</a></strong> works at Mozilla Research on Servo, a new browser engine written in Rust and designed from the ground up for parallelism and safety. He also works on CSS specifications at W3C's CSS Working Group.</p>

          <p><strong><em>MissingNo., my favourite Pok&eacute;mon!</em></strong></p>

          <p>Missing Pok&eacute;mon! Glitch City! Cloning! The Pok&eacute;mon series featured some spectacular glitches that can teach us a lot about programming, computers, and distributed systems. When programs behave in unexpected ways, we gain the opportunity to change outcomes by using programming as a subversive act.  Breaking the rules can open up new worlds!</p>

          <p>I love glitches. <3</p>

          <p><strong><em>Recovering data from an SD card &mdash; the hard way!</em></strong></p>

          <p>A while ago, I accidentally snapped an SD card in half. It had a bunch of photos on it that I didn't have backed up, but on the other hand, I don't believe in losing data! After discovering that the memory chip on it was still intact, but that the controller chip was dead, I decided to try to pull the data out of the raw memory chip.  Along the way, I learned a whole bunch of stuff about flash memory.  I also learned that people jump through a lot of hoops in order to make flash memory behave like a hard drive, when in reality, the two aren't much alike at all!</p>

          <p>In this talk, I'll tell you more about the story of putting the pieces back together, and I'll give you an introduction to some of those strange things that people do with flash.  Also, you can laugh at me for not making backups.</p>

          <p class="speaker-bio"><strong><a href="http://www.joshuawise.com/">Joshua</a></strong> spends most of his time at work during the week alternating between writing specifications that turn into chips and reading climbing blogs.  He doesn't really believe in learning his lesson, either, and probably will show up to his talk with an SD card hanging out of the side of his laptop, ready to be smashed in half once again.</p>
