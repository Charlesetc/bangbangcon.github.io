          <h3>The !!Con 2015 CFP is closed.</h3>
          <p>Thank you so much to everyone who submitted a propsal! We're currently reviewing all of your wonderful ideas,
          	and we'll get back to everyone on April 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
        
          <h2>Call for talk proposals!</h2>

          <p>Hi friends! !!Con is <strong>back</strong> for 2015 and we want <strong>you</strong> to submit a talk.</p>

          <p>Have you written a program to make something you love? Do you have a favorite algorithm or data structure? A great story about how programming saved the day in a surprising way? A tool that you learned about and now you're telling everyone and their cat? We like good storytelling and unreasonable excitement more than programming wizardry (though wizard stories are very welcome!).</p>

          <p>We want to hear from programmers and artists and tinkerers and practical types. We want to hear from you if you love programming for its own sake, or if you don't really see the intrinsic joy of programming but love what you can create with it.</p>

          <p>The only requirements are that your talk:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>be programming-related</li>
            <li>be about something you think is interesting</li>
            <li><strong>have at least one exclamation mark in the title!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>We would <strong>especially</strong> like to hear from you if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>you submitted a talk last year (we had to reject <strong>so many</strong> talk proposals we loved).</li>
            <li>you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming conferences. We're committed to doing work to make !!Con a good experience for more people.  See our <a href="accessibility.html">accessibility information</a> and <a href="conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>All talks will be ten minutes long.</strong> Ten minutes isn't much time, so think carefully about the scope of your talk. A single, focused idea is better than a broad, rambling one.</p>

          <p>The submission deadline is <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150331T235959&p0=179&msg=!!Con+2015+CFP+Deadline&csz=1">March 31</a>. We'll accept as many of your amazing talks as we can. You can submit more than one talk proposal.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposals will be anonymized.</strong> Although we ask for your name, email address, and so on in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bBOypUR1yRWm3N37IOOyV-Ag0gquE218CSKO8xaWcaI/viewform">proposal submission form</a>, only Alex, our chief anonymizer, and a few volunteer anonymizers will actually see this information. All reviewing of proposals will be done anonymously, to avoid bias. </p>

          <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bBOypUR1yRWm3N37IOOyV-Ag0gquE218CSKO8xaWcaI/viewform">Submit your talk proposal today!</a></p>

          <a name="speaker-funding"></a>
          <h2>Speaker travel funding</h2>

          <p>This year, we are looking into the possibility of offering financial assistance for travel and lodging for outside-of-NYC speakers.  If you're not from the NYC area and you want to request funding, check the box at the bottom of <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bBOypUR1yRWm3N37IOOyV-Ag0gquE218CSKO8xaWcaI/viewform">the proposal submission form</a>.  If you check the box and we accept your proposal, we will let you know if we can provide the assistance by April 16th.  You will then have until April 21 to decide whether to accept our invitation to speak.</p>

          <p>Because submissions are reviewed anonymously, checking the box to request financial assistance will not affect a proposal's chances of acceptance.</p>

          <p>Thanks for submitting to !!Con!</p>
