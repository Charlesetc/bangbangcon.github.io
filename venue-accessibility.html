          <h2>Venue and accessibility information</h2>

          <p>We're excited to announce !!Con 2016's
          venue: <a href="http://thehallbrooklyn.com/">the Hall at
          MP</a> in Brooklyn, NYC!</p>

          <h3>Getting there</h3>

          <p>The Hall is at <strong>470 Driggs Avenue</strong> in
          Brooklyn, NYC.  It is 0.2 miles from the Bedford Avenue
          subway station
          (<a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/lline.htm">L</a>
          line), 0.4 miles from the Metropolitan Avenue station
          (<a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/gline.htm">G</a>
          line), and 0.9 miles from the Marcy Avenue station
          (<a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/jline.htm">J</a>/M/Z
          lines).</p>

          <p>The Marcy Avenue station
          is <a href="http://web.mta.info/accessibility/stations.htm#brooklyn">ADA
          accessible</a> and there are elevators at the corner of
          Marcy Avenue and Broadway.  You
          can <a href="http://advisory.nymta.info/EEoutage/EEOutageReport.aspx?StationID=4C108099-5012-4A56-ACF4-601F32327B10&Station=MARCY%20AV%20STATION%20-%20J/M/Z">check
          elevator status</a> before your trip.</p>

          <p>Detailed <a href="http://thehallbrooklyn.com/about/directions/">subway
          and driving directions</a> are available on the venue's
          website.</p>

          <h3>Bigger and better!</h3>

          <p>For space reasons, past !!Cons have been limited to just
          over 100 attendees.  This year, we'll have capacity
          for <strong>200+ attendees</strong>.  YES!</p>

          <p>We're painfully aware that in the past, a lot of people
          who have wanted to attend !!Con weren't able to snag a
          ticket due to our limited space.  We're hoping to do a lot
          better in that regard this year!</p>

          <p>Plus, we'll have a professional-quality sound and
          lighting system!  (And professionals who know how to run
          it!)  Sweet.</p>

          <h3>Alcohol-free and all-ages</h3>

          <p>We remain an <strong>alcohol-free event</strong>, as
          always.  All ages are welcome.  (Don't be misled by the fact
          that we're holding the event at a music venue and event
          space that often serves alcohol!  That doesn't apply to
          !!Con.)</p>

          <h3>CART captioning</h3>

          <p>!!Con 2016 will have CART ("Communication Access Realtime
          Transcription" or "Computer-Assisted Real-Time", depending
          on who you ask) live transcription in English, provided by
          Certified CART
          Provider <a href="http://stenoknight.com/">Mirabai
          Knight</a>.  Mirabai first captioned !!Con in 2014, and it
          was great.  We're excited to have her back for an
          encore!</p>
