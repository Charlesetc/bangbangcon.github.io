# Bangbangcon: May 17-18, 2014
## Hacker School, NYC

!!Con (pronounced bang bang con) is two days of ten-minute talks (with lots of breaks, of course!) about what excites us about programming â€” the amazing, the strange, and the heartwarming. From kernel exploits to teaching kids to program, !!Con is about bringing the NYC programming community together to celebrate the joy and excitement and the surprising moments in what we do. By 'programming community' we mean anyone who programs, regardless of whether they are employed as a programmer, so we look forward to talks from wonderful speakers of diverse backgrounds!

The conference will be held at Hacker School, near the intersection of Broadway and Grand Street in Manhattan. !!Con will be free to attend, but space is limited.
