        <h2> Call for Proposals!!!</h2>
        </center>
          <p>
            !!Con is a conference about what excites us about programming. It's
            about amazing things, surprising things and fun things. It's about
            strange things and silly things and heartwarming things. Did you find
            a super weird bug? Have you learned a programming language that kinda
            blew your mind? Did you teach some kids to program and they did
            something AMAZING? Did your program make you giggle? We want to hear
            about it. At !!Con, we're nonjudgemental. We don't care if what you
            talk about is "basic" or "not smart enough" or "done before". If you
            think it's cool, we want to hear from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only requirement are that your talk:
            <ul>
              <li> be programming-related </li>
              <li> be something you think is cool</li>
              <li>have an exclamation mark in the title </li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            All talks are 10 minutes, with 5 minutes for questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The submission deadline is March 31. We'll accept as many
            of your amazing talks as we can. You can submit more than
            one talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proposals are anonymized.
