          <h2>Call for talk proposals!</h2>

          <p>Hi friends! !!Con is <strong>back</strong> for 2015 and we want <strong>you</strong> to submit a talk.</p>

          <p>Have you written a program to make something you love? Do you have a favorite algorithm or data structure? A great story about how programming saved the day in a surprising way? A tool that you learned about and now you're telling everyone and their cat? We like good storytelling and unreasonable excitement more than programming wizardry (though wizard stories are very welcome!).</p>

          <p>We want to hear from programmers and artists and tinkerers and practical types. We want to hear from you if you love programming for its own sake, or if you don't really see the intrinsic joy of programming but love what you can create with it.</p>

          <p>The only requirements are that your talk:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>be programming-related</li>
            <li>be about something you think is interesting</li>
            <li><strong>have at least one exclamation mark in the title!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>We would <em>especially</em> like to hear from you if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>you submitted a talk last year (we had to reject <em>so many</em> talk proposals we loved).</li>
            <li>you find that people like you are underrepresented at programming conferences. We've done work to make !!Con a good experience for more people. To see what we're working on, see <a href="todo">our page about that</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>All talks will be ten minutes long.</strong> Ten minutes isn't much time, so think carefully about the scope of your talk. A single, focused idea is better than a broad, rambling one.</p>

          <p>The submission deadline is <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20150331T235959&p0=179&msg=!!Con+2015+CFP+Deadline&csz=1">March 31</a>. We'll accept as many of your amazing talks as we can. You can submit more than one talk proposal.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposals will be anonymized.</strong> Although we ask for your name, email address, and so on in the <a href="todo">proposal submission form</a>, only Alex, our chief anonymizer, and a few volunteer anonymizers will actually see this information. All reviewing of proposals will be done anonymously, to avoid bias. </p>

          <p><a href="todo">Submit your talk proposal today!</a></p>
