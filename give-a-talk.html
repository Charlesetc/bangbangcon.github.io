          <h3>Call for proposals!</h3>

          <p>!!Con is a conference about what excites us about
          programming. It's about amazing things, surprising things
          and fun things. It's about strange things and silly things
          and heartwarming things. Did you find a super-weird bug?
          Have you learned a programming language that kinda blew your
          mind? Did you teach some kids to program and they did
          something <em>amazing</em>? Did your program make you
          giggle? We want to hear about it. We don't care if what you
          talk about is “basic” or “not smart enough” or “done before”
          &mdash; if you think it's cool, we want to hear from
          you.</p>

          <p>The only requirements are that your talk:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>be programming-related</li>
            <li>be about something you think is cool</li>
            <li><strong>have at least one exclamation mark in the
            title!</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>All talks will be <strong>ten minutes long</strong>,
          followed by five minutes for questions.  Ten minutes isn't
          much time, so think carefully about the scope of your talk.
          A single, focused idea is better than a broad, rambling
          one.</p>

          <p><strong>The submission deadline
          is <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20140331T235959&p0=179&msg=!!Con+CFP+Deadline">March
          31</a>.</strong>  We'll accept as many of your amazing talks
          as we can. You can submit more than one talk proposal.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposals will be anonymized.</strong>  Although
          we ask for your name, email address, and so on in
          the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vtgUImhHgOH3vx_yo5ZjUbf6c6p4HUj_RCa_5-VqCfI/viewform">proposal
          submission form</a>, only one person (Alex, our chief
          anonymizer) will actually see this information.  All
          reviewing of proposals will be done anonymously, to avoid
          bias.</p>

          <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vtgUImhHgOH3vx_yo5ZjUbf6c6p4HUj_RCa_5-VqCfI/viewform">Submit
          your talk proposal today!</a></p>
