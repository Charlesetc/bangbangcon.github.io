		  <p><strong><em>Help! Help!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>This catalog of Perl introspection techniques will amaze,
		  confound, or disgust you!  A Perl method call like
		  <code>$object->fgsfds()</code> emits an unhelpful message
		  about an unknown method, without any advice about what
		  <em>would</em> have worked.</p>

		  <p>We will see the internals of <code>Help.pm</code>, a Perl
		  module which catches an attempt to call an undefined method,
		  and emits a helpful list of valid method names.</p>

		  <p>First, we will see how the <code>Help</code> module
		  forcibly inserts itself into the inheritance hierarchy for
		  the target module, so that failed method lookups will be
		  dispatched to <code>Help</code> when normal inheritance
		  fails. Then we will see Perl's <code>AUTOLOAD</code>
		  feature, the method of last
		  resort. The <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method
		  in <code>Help</code> will then search the inheritance
		  hierarchy synthetically, using Perl's symbol table
		  interface, to locate methods of interest. Finally, the
		  <code>AUTOLOAD</code> method will emit a report about what
		  was found.</p>

		  <p>When I started developing Flopkestra, a floppy drive

		  <p>In this talk, I will describe my (ongoing) quest to get
		  from whistling a tune into my laptop microphone to hearing
		  the melody bursting out of floppy drives.</p>

		  <p>What began as an idea to produce some noise out of

		  of hardware hacking, MIDI file parsing, digital signal
		  processing and HTML5 canvas programming, none of which I
		  knew anything about before starting this project.</p>

		  <p>While yak shaving is generally considered to be the enemy

		  <p>Pick up almost any word game and you'll find that its

		  words. As computer programmers, we can do more sophisticated

		  <p>You want to chat securely with me, but I'm too lazy to
		  switch from Facebook chat. How can we embed a secure channel
		  inside Facebook?</p>

		  <p>Let's make a Chrome extension that sits on top of
		  Facebook's chat interface! But what if Facebook is the
		  enemy, or is co-opted by the enemy? How do we cope with
		  securing output and input in an environment that is out to
		  get us?</p>

		  <p>I'll explain my naive take on the problem, talk about
		  some cool attacks, and then explain how I countered each
		  attack.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>How I used my knowledge of code (and music!)
		  to help fight fires!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Rural areas often require emergency responders to carry
		  "pagers" with them to be informed about fires and other
		  emergencies. These pagers are actually specialized radios,
		  each specially configured to respond to one type of message
		  intended for the individual carrying it.</p>

		  <p>Aside from requiring users to carry an extra device, this
		  system has many drawbacks, including range and battery life
		  limitations. Recently I worked with a company that has been
		  building a system to bridge the gap between this old
		  broadcast system and mobile devices. I helped to improve the
		  reliability and ease of configuration of their systems by
		  rewriting the code which is responsible for recording the
		  radio broadcasts and decoding the signals which are used to
		  identify the intended recipients of the messages.</p>

		  <p>I will discuss how the system works and also do a quick
		  demo. The demo is a lot of fun in no small part because it
		  involves various hardware, including a small Linux box, a
		  radio, and funny tones and recorded sounds.</p>

		  School</a> (Bronx Academy for Software Engineering) to
		  program some robots. The result was amazing. We laughed; the
		  robots danced and taught us how to do the douggy; we saw
		  weird stuff on the Internet. Technology brought two

		  <p><strong><em>Now you're thinking with PCMPISTRI!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>I needed a custom string comparison routine, and the C
		  version wasn't fast enough. It turns out that modern Intel
		  processors have SIMD instructions that understand C-style
		  strings. So I considered writing a faster version in
		  assembly language. I actually ended up solving the problem a
		  different way, but I decided to write the SIMD assembly
		  version anyway. This sort of programming is tremendously
		  fun, because you have these weird instructions and you have
		  to try to solve your problem under bizarre and arbitrary
		  constraints.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Just LOOK at the humongous type that
		  Hindley-Milner infers for this tiny
		  program!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Hindley-Milner (H-M) type inference is an algorithm which
		  deduces static types in programming languages like OCaml and
		  Haskell, where the programmer does not have to explicitly
		  declare types. Its performance is usually described as
		  either "fast enough" or "worst case exponential" depending
		  on who you ask, and whether they're being formal about it or
		  trying to sell you on one of these languages.</p>

		  <p>It turns out that H-M actually <em>is</em> exponential in
		  time and space in the worst case. There's a really tiny
		  program that demonstrates this. It's only around 100
		  characters long, but the type that H-M infers is thousands
		  of characters long! The existence of this edge case is
		  fascinating, even though in practice H-M is fast enough for
		  most programs.</p>

		  <p><strong><em>Proofs about programs, proofs as programs,
		  and programs as proofs!</em></strong></p>

		  <p>Say you had two pieces of code that looked different, but
		  you strongly suspected they were "equal." Maybe you have two
		  <code>if</code> statements and you're a compiler who wants
		  to optimize code by exchanging one for the other. How would
		  you prove that they were equal? And since you're already a
		  compiler, why don't we verify your proof with a
		  computer?!</p>

		  <p>We'll take a tour through the world of interactive
		  theorem proving with <a href="http://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>,
		  a proof assistant. We'll use Coq to interactively prove that
		  two pieces of code, though they look different, are "equal"
		  in that they return the same values for all inputs. Our
		  proof will lead us to examine the strange correspondence
		  between proofs and programs. It's an exciting development at
		  the frontier of CS and math research: a data type is a
		  proposition, and a value of that type is a proof of that
		  proposition!</p>
